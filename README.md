# creative-coding-lib

A very early stages TypeScript library for my creative coding projects.

The development process of this library happens as I am using it, so I am building it up based on requirements dictated by whatever my current projects are. I believe this will help ensure it generalizes well and suits all the needs of those engaging in creative coding. As such, I have not yet taken the time to organize modules into folders, or add proper documentation.
